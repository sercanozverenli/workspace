# Conceptual Framework and the Fundamental Problem in the Literature

Today, whether in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, or end-to-end industrial automation systems working with sensors; a significant portion of data-driven decision mechanisms share a common structural limitation. Most of these systems lack a mechanism that independently evaluates the reliability of the data prior to the decision process. Instead, they focus on generating an output from the provided input as much as possible. In other words, in most cases, systems lack an upper decision layer capable of abstaining from generating a decision by stating, "I cannot make a reliable decision with this data."

The real-world impacts of this structural limitation are not merely theoretical; significant events in the history of automation and artificial intelligence clearly demonstrate this problem.

**Sensor and Automation Disaster (Boeing 737 MAX MCAS):** The MCAS system generated incorrect correction commands due to faulty data from the sensors measuring the aircraft's angle of attack (AoA). Since the system lacked a decision mechanism that independently questioned the reliability of the sensor data or transferred control to the pilot by deeming the data unreliable, it accepted the faulty data as valid and made repeated automatic interventions pointing the nose down.

**Artificial Intelligence Classification Blindness (Autonomous Vehicle Accidents):** In some accidents in the autonomous driving literature (for example, the white truck accident that occurred in 2016), the image processing system failed to distinguish the white truck trailer on the road from the bright sky. Encountering this data bearing Out-of-Distribution characteristics, the model, instead of flagging the data as unreliable and switching to a safe mode, misinterpreted the input and consequently failed to apply the brakes.

This phenomenon, discussed as **False Confidence** in the artificial intelligence literature, stems from the model's inability to accurately express its own uncertainty in the face of unreliable data or data outside the training distribution. In this study, this situation is addressed within the framework of the **Information Collapse** concept, the critical threshold where the data largely loses its statistical meaning. During moments of Information Collapse, the system may continue to generate predictions despite lacking the statistical foundation to produce a reliable decision. Especially in high-risk applications, the cost of this situation can yield much heavier consequences than the system safely stopping itself, switching to a more cautious decision mechanism, or requesting help from a human operator.

The **Amplify Core (DRDRS)** proposed in this study is a model-agnostic decision routing architecture targeting this gap in the literature. Being model-agnostic here means that the architecture can operate on the same principle regardless of whether the main decision-maker is a deep learning-based artificial intelligence model, a classical statistical method, or a simple sensor-based rule engine. Amplify Core acts as an independent **Statistical Security Checkpoint** by evaluating the reliability of the data before transmitting it to the main decision mechanism and determines the appropriate decision regime based on the obtained result.

The fundamental approach of the system is to abandon the notion that assumes algorithms must generate a prediction under all circumstances, and instead, to direct the following fundamental question to the data itself prior to the decision process:

> **"How statistically safe is it to generate a reliable decision with the current data quality?"**

# Operational Analogy: Decision Making Regimes

The decision regimes adopted by Amplify Core based on the state of the data can be summarized with a four-stage autonomous driving scenario:

**Clean Data (Sunny Weather):** Visibility is clear. The data is reliable. The system continues to operate at normal performance using the main model.

**Noisy Data (Rainy / Muddy Windshield):** There are temporary distortions in the data. The Stabilization Layer steps in to eliminate the deficiencies as much as possible, and the data is routed back to the main model.

**Corrupt Data (Dense Fog):** The issue is no longer just superficial noise; the reliability of the information obtained from the environment has decreased significantly. In this case, the system disables the main model and continues to operate with a more conservative, rule-based, or safety-oriented **Fallback Model**.

**Information Collapse (Pitch Black and Broken Headlights):** The current data no longer carries enough statistical information to generate any reliable decision. In such a case, instead of generating a prediction, the system applies the **Abstention** strategy; it safely halts the process, hands it over to a human operator, or requests support from a higher-level control mechanism. This is because generating an incorrect decision under these conditions carries a higher risk than generating no decision at all.

This four-stage safety approach, concretized through the autonomous driving analogy, forms the core of Amplify Core's technical architecture. As seen in the data routing diagram below, instead of unconditionally transmitting the incoming raw data to the main decision model, the system first passes the data through the DRS (Data Reliability Score) layer to measure its statistical health and routes it to the safest decision regime based on the obtained result.
